# EXPERIMENTS

We ran predictions with Traveler on all molecules of known small ribosomal subunits of organisms from the Metazoa kingdom.
The [CRW](http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu/DAT/3A/Summary/index.php) database contains structures of 16 such organisms -
Androctonus australis, Artemia salina, Drosophila melanogaster, Echinococcus granulosus, Homo sapiens,
Microciona prolifera, Mnemiopsis leidyi, Mus musculus, Mytilus edulis, Okanagana utahensis,
Oryctolagus cuniculus, Placopecten magellanicus, Rattus norvegicus, Tripedalia cystophora,
Xenopus borealis, Xenopus laevist (Crossodonthina koreana was not downloadable).

## TEST FILES
All test files can be downloaded [here](http://richard.ba30.eu/traveler/img/input/18S/).
For each organism, there is one Post-script (.ps) file with visualization and one Vienna/DBN (.fasta)
file containing structure secondary structure of the molecule.

## RESULTS
We ran application TRAVeLer on all input molecules. We test visualization - every molecule to every molecule.
