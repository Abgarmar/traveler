# EXPERIMENTS

We ran experiments for our proposed tool on all molecules of known small ribosomal subunit 18S from the Metazoa kingdom.
The [CRW](http://www.rna.icmb.utexas.edu/DAT/3A/Summary/index.php) database contains structures of 16 organism -
Androctonus australis, Artemia salina, Drosophila melanogaster, Echinococcus granulosus, Homo sapiens,
Microciona prolifera, Mnemiopsis leidyi, Mus musculus, Mytilus edulis, Okanagana utahensis,
Oryctolagus cuniculus, Placopecten magellanicus, Rattus norvegicus, Tripedalia cystophora,
Xenopus borealis, Xenopus laevist (Crossodonthina koreana was not downloadable).

## TEST FILES
All test files are downloadable [here](http://richard.ba30.eu/traveler/img/input/18S/).
For each organism, there is one Post-script (.ps) file with visualization and one Vienna/DBN (.fasta)
file containing structure secondary structure of molecule.

## RESULTS
We ran application TRAVeLer on all input molecules. We test visualization - every molecule to every molecule.
